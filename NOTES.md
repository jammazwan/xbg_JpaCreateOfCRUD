### JpaCreateOfCRUD NOTES:

This is the simplest possible project I could make with all the parts necessary to create a record in a local Derby database.

It has one simple query only, which is just to validate that the actual record was written.

There are normal parts to a JPA project which are not included here, for example transactional capabilities.
